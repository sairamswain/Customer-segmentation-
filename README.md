# Customer-segmentation-
This project focuses on customer segmentation using data analysis and machine learning techniques. The goal is to segment customers into different groups based on their purchasing behavior and demographics to improve marketing strategies, customer service, and business decision-making.

# Project Overview -
Customer segmentation is the process of dividing a customer base into distinct groups based on similar characteristics. These characteristics can include demographics, purchasing behavior, or other customer data. This segmentation allows businesses to tailor marketing efforts and create more personalized experiences for customers.

In this project, we use machine learning models to classify customers into various segments. These segments can be used to improve customer engagement, target specific market segments, and provide better services.

# Key Features -
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess customer data (handle missing values, encode categorical variables, etc.)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize and analyze data to identify trends and patterns.
Clustering: Apply machine learning techniques such as K-Means clustering to segment customers into groups.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model using appropriate metrics (e.g., silhouette score, inertia).
Visualization: Visualize the segmented groups with charts to interpret results.

# Technologies Used -
Python (for data analysis and modeling)
Pandas (for data manipulation and analysis)
Matplotlib / Seaborn (for data visualization)
Scikit-learn (for machine learning models)
Jupyter Notebook (for interactive coding and documentation)
